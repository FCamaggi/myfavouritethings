## 2. Game Overview

In this game, players choose a theme that everyone relates to, and then determine what other players rank as "the most favorite things" and "do not favorite thing (the Mine)". By asking and guessing each other's favorites, you can learn more about your friends' tastes and dislikes. The player who collects the most points at the end wins.

## 3. Preparation

### 2-1. Theme Cards

This game has theme cards. Once per game, take one card and say "STOP!". The player who stopped will decide the theme.

### 2-2. Card Preparation

1. **Distribute Hands:** Give each player a set of Hand Cards (numbered 1 to 5 in one color).
2. **Write the Theme:** One player (Start Player) decides a theme and writes it on the center of the Theme Card (e.g., "Sushi", "Color", "Animal").
3. **Place the Card:** Place the theme card in the center of the table so everyone can see it.

## 4. How to Play

### 3-1. Write & Rank

According to the theme, every player secretly writes down their items.

- **Rank 1:** Write your absolute **Favorite** thing.
- **Rank 2-4:** Write things you **Like** (standard favorites).
- **Rank 5:** Write something you **Dislike** or simply doesn't fit the "Favorite" vibe. This is the **"Mine"** (Trap).

_Note: Do not show your answers to other players yet._

Once all players have written their items, place the cards face down in front of them (or hold them in hand, ensuring the order 1-5 is remembered or written as indicated).

_(Visual Diagram shows players writing on the back of cards or a specific sheet, arranging them 1 through 5, where 1 is "Love" and 5 is the "Mine/Taboo")._

### 3-2. Call (Guessing)

Starting with the Start Player, the turn proceeds clockwise.
On your turn, choose one other player and try to **guess one of their items**.

1. **Ask:** Ask a specific player: "Is [Item Name] on your list?"
2. **Reveal:**

- **If the item IS NOT on their list:** The player says "No". Your turn ends.
- **If the item IS on their list:** The player must reveal the rank (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- _Scoring occurs immediately based on the Rank revealed (see Scoring section below)._

---

## 5. Scoring Rules

When you successfully guess an item on another player's list:

1. **Rank 1 (The Favorite):**

- If you guess the item that is their **Rank 1**: You get **2 Points**.
- The owner of the card also gets points (Cooperation bonus, text unclear, usually 1 point).
- _The guessed card is revealed and stays face up._

2. **Rank 2, 3, 4 (The Likes):**

- If you guess an item that is **Rank 2, 3, or 4**: You get **1 Point**.
- _The guessed card is revealed and stays face up._

3. **Rank 5 (The Mine/Trap):**

- If you guess the item that is **Rank 5**:
- **BOOM!** You hit the mine.
- **Penalty:** You get **0 Points** (and usually your turn ends immediately).
- The owner of the mine might get points (text is small/blurry here, but often in these games, deceiving others gives points).

## 6. End of Round & Game

### The Second Round

The round continues until everyone's cards are revealed OR a certain condition is met (e.g., all Rank 1s are found).

- Change the Start Player (pass the marker/token).
- Choose a new Theme.
- Repeat the writing and guessing steps.

### End of the Game

The game ends when **everyone has been the Start Player once** (or after a set number of rounds determined by the group).

**Winning:**
Calculate the total score.

- Points from guessing others correctly.
- Points from having your own items guessed (if applicable).
- The player with the highest score wins!
- If there is a tie, the player who hit the fewest "Mines" (Rank 5s) wins. Or, share the victory!

## Flavor Text / Story (Bottom Right)

_(Translated from the Japanese text section "前略...")_

**"Dear [Friend], How have you been?"**

One day, a letter arrived.
It was an invitation to a party where we talk about our favorite things.
"I want to know more about you."
"I want to tell you what I love."

Through this party, you will learn important things about your friends and your friendship will deepen.

Sincerely,
_The Game Master_
